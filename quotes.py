#Romeo and Juliet - Shakespeare
"""Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
The which if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.""",

#Hamlet - Shakespeare
"""To be, or not to be - that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep - 
No more - and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep - 
To sleep - perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub,
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprise of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action.  -  Soft you now,
The fair Ophelia!  -  Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remembered.""",

#Tale of Two Cities - C. Dickens
"""It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light,
it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair,
we had everything before us,
we had nothing before us,
we were all going direct to Heaven,
we were all going direct the other way - 
in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of
its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.""",

#Metamorphosis - Franz Kafka
"""One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, 
he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. 
He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a 
little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided 
by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to 
cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, 
pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved 
about helplessly as he looked.""",

#Communist Manifesto
"""The history of all hitherto existing society is the history 
of class struggles.

Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, 
guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, 
stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an 
uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each 
time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society 
at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.

In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a 
complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold 
gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, 
knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, 
vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost 
all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.

The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of 
feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has 
but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new 
forms of struggle in place of the old ones.""",

#US Declaration of Independence
"""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created 
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable 
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, 
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, 
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, 
it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute 
new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing 
its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect 
their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that 
Governments long established should not be changed for light and 
transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind 
are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right 
themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a 
long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object 
evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, 
it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards 
for their future security.""",

#Lolita - Vivian Darkbloom
"""Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta:
the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap,
at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.

She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one
sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on
the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita"""
